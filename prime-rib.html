  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you.</p>
        
    <p>This simple, foolproof "mathematical method" for making the very best prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success. Here is the formula: Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes. For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) prime rib roast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unslated butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours</li> 
        <li>Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F</li>
        <li>Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, see footnote to calculate cooking time.)</li>
        <li>Turn oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>
      </ol>
